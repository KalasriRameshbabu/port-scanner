# 🔍 Port Scanner Using Python

This is a GUI-based **Port Scanner** developed as part of the **RISE Internship – Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Project**. It scans for open ports on a given IP address or domain using multi-threading and socket programming.


## 📌 Problem Statement

Network ports are entry points for services. Open or vulnerable ports can be exploited by attackers. This tool helps identify such open ports for basic vulnerability assessment.


## 🎯 Objective

To build a user-friendly port scanner that detects open TCP ports on a given IP address or website using Python.


## 💡 Features

- 🖥️ GUI interface with Tkinter
- ⚙️ Scans top 1024 TCP ports
- 🧵 Uses multithreading for faster scanning
- ✅ Displays all open ports in real-time
- 📶 Accepts IP address or domain name
- 📋 Clean and modern layout


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- `socket` (for network communication)
- `threading` (for concurrency)
- `tkinter` (for GUI)
- `queue` (to manage tasks)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Save the code as `port_scanner.py`.
3. Open terminal or command prompt in that folder.
4. Run:

```bash
python port_scanner.py
